# Ebuy
Ebuy is an e-shop for online ticket purchases.

It uses a custom SSL-configured local intranet Apache server with a local Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), created from scratch, for issuing certificates, that consists of one self-signed Root CA and one Intermediate CA for creating server and client certificates.

Note: The Angular code in the ebuy.com directory wasn't written by me.
